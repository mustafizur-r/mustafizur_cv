\cvItemListStart
  \cvItem{Developed an AI system that generates clinically meaningful impaired-gait animations from structured clinical text and visualizes them as 3D virtual patients for therapist training.}
  \cvItem{Retrained the MoMask text-to-motion model on a curated gait-focused dataset and therapist-supervised recordings to capture asymmetric and pathological gait.}
  \cvItem{Built a full pipeline including motion generation, Blender-based retargeting, and real-time visualization in Unity.}
